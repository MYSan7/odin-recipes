        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>No oven? No problem! All you need for this light, decadent cheesecake is a fridge. Great for special occasionsâ€”and Oreo fans!</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>36 chocolate sandwich cookies</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>3 cups cream cheese (800 g)</li>
            <li>1/3 cup sugar (65 g)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup milk (240 mL), warm</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon gelatin</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Separate the cream from the cookies into 2 different bowls.</li>
            <li>Place the cookies into a plastic bag and crush them into fine crumbs with a rolling pin. Set aside 1/2 cup (50g) of the crumbs for later.</li>
            <li>Pour the cookie crumbs into a bowl and combine with the melted butter, mixing until the texture is like slightly wet sand.</li>
            <li>Press the cookie crumbs in an even layer into the bottom of a 9-inch (23 cm) springform pan. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a medium pot over low heat, mix together the cream cheese, sugar, the cream from the cookies, and vanilla extract, stirring until there are no lumps.</li>
            <li>In a measuring cup, mix the milk with the gelatin until dissolved.</li>
            <li>Pour the milk into the cream cheese mixture, stirring constantly until the mixture starts to bubble slightly. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture over the cookie crust in the springform pan. Using a spatula or a spoon, smooth the top.</li>
            <li>Sift the saved cookie crumbs on top of the cheesecake in an even layer, then refrigerate for at least 4 hours.</li>
            <li>Unclasp the ring of the springform pan, slice, then serve!</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
